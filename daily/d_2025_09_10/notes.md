# ðŸ“’ Notes for 2025-09-10

## âœ… Topic Covered
**Subsequences with Sum = K (Recursion + Backtracking)**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Problems Practiced
1. **Printing all subsequences whose sum = K**
    - Explored all subsequences using recursion (include/exclude approach).
    - Collected valid subsequences in a result list.

2. **Printing any ONE subsequence whose sum = K**
    - Similar approach, but stopped recursion once the first valid subsequence was found.
    - Optimized compared to the "print all" version.

3. **Counting subsequences whose sum = K**
    - Did not store subsequences, only counted them.
    - More space-efficient.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- **Recursion Choices**: At each index â†’ Pick or Not Pick.
- **Base Case**:
    - If index == n:
        - Check if sum == K.
- **Backtracking**: Important when storing subsequences (`add â†’ recurse â†’ remove`).
- **Optimization**: Stop recursion early if only one subsequence is required.
- **Complexity**:
    - Time â†’ O(2^n), since each element has 2 choices.
    - Space â†’ O(n) recursion stack depth.

## ðŸ“Œ Extra Notes
- This problem is a **subset of Subset Sum problems** (can extend to DP later).
- Variations learned today:
    - Print All
    - Print One
    - Count Total
- Helps in building the foundation for **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.
